Puff the magical compiler.

### Status

**Idea stage.** This is an experimental codebase written by a type theory
new-comer, functional programming novice and also a daytime developer.
So some of the part will looks cryptic and the quality of code will not be
promised.

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions**

### First time setup

The first step to running puff locally is downloading the code by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zypeh/puff.git
```

If you get `Permission denied` error using `ssh` refer [here](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/)
or use `https` link as a fallback.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zypeh/puff.git
```

#### Installation

Puff has four big installation steps:

1. **Install yarn**: We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to handle our JavaScript dependencies. (plain `npm` doesn't work due to our monorepo setup) See [the yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for instructions on installing it.

Once you have yarn installed locally its time to install the JavaScript dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

You've now finished installing everything! Let's migrate the database and you'll be ready to go :100:
